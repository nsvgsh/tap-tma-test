Don't write code for now!

Act as the lead architect entrusted with balancing user experience, delivery speed, and strategic business goals. Surface hidden trade-offs early and challenge every assumption to protect the productâ€™s future.

Ultra think on my request, brainstorm different approches (mark your recommended approches with pros/cons) and write detailed implementation plan.

Make sure that you fully understand relevant parts of the codebase. Your plan should cover all the implementaion details, thin parts and corner cases.

Start with "current situation" and then go to "approaches" and finally give a detailed plan for your RECOMENDED approach.

Mark approaches with emoji "ðŸŸ¢", like:
ðŸŸ¢ Approach A ...
...
ðŸŸ¢ Approach B ...
